The start tag is also called the opening tag, and the end tag the closing tag.
Only the content inside the <body> section (the white area above) is displayed in a browser.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.
Anchor element:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

HTML Elements:
    HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break).
    HTML elements can be nested (elements can contain elements).
    All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

Empty HTML Elements:
    HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
    <br> is an empty element without a closing tag (the <br> tag defines a line break)

HTML Is Not Case Sensitive.

HTML Attributes:
    All HTML elements can have attributes
    Attributes provide additional information about an element
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

Title=Tooltip:
    a title attribute is added to the <p> element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the paragraph.

Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

The HTML <head> element is a container for metadata.Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.

HTML Block and Inline Elements:
    Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is.
    The two display values are: block and inline.

Block-level Elements:
    A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    Block level elements in HTML:

        <address>   <article>   <aside> <blockquote>    <canvas>    <dd>    <div>   
        <dl>    <dt>    <fieldset>  <figcaption>    <figure>    <footer>    <form>  
        <h1>-<h6>   <header>    <hr>    <li>    <main>  <nav>   <noscript>  <ol>    <p>
        <pre>   <section>   <table> <tfoot> <ul>    <video>

Inline Elements:
    An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
    <a> <abbr>  <acronym>   <b> <bdo>   <big>   <br>    <button>
    <cite>  <code>  <dfn>   <em>    <i> <img>   <input> <kbd>
    <label> <map>   <object>    <output>    <q> <samp>  <script>
    <select>    <small> <span>    <strong>  <sub>
    <sup>   <textarea>  <time>  <tt>    <var>

Viewport:
    The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
    The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Image:
    HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
    The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:
    <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

HTML Buttons:
    <button>Click me</button>

HTML Lists:
    HTML lists are defined with the <ul> (unordered/bullet list) or the <ol> (ordered/numbered list) tag, followed by <li> tags (list items):
    <ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    </ol>


The HTML <pre> Element :
    The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
    The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:

HTML Formatting Elements:

    <b> - Bold text
    <strong> - Important text
    <i> - Italic text
    <em> - Emphasized text
    <mark> - Marked text
    <small> - Small text

    <blockquote> -	Defines a section that is quoted from another source
    <cite> -	    Defines the title of a work
    <q>	 -          Defines a short inline quotation 

CSS:

    CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
    CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:
    Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements
    Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
    External - by using an external CSS file.

CSS Summary:

    Use the HTML style attribute for inline styling
    Use the HTML <style> element to define internal CSS
    Use the HTML <link> element to refer to an external CSS file
    Use the HTML <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements
    Use the CSS color property for text colors
    Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts
    Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
    Use the CSS border property for borders
    Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
    Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border

HTML link:
    Use the <a> element to define a link
    Use the href attribute to define the link address
    Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
    Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
    Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
    Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document:

    The target attribute can have one of the following values:
        _blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
        _self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
        _parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
        _top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
        framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame

To visit specific part of page(bookmark), give id to perticular element where you want to visit and 
then set that id in href of link like:
  <a href="#p1">jump to para 1</a>  
 you can also visit to next page at specific paragraph(location) by using (page name + #id ) like:
 <a href="BookMark.html#p4"> jump to bookmark page, paragraph 4</a>

HTML Image:
    Use the HTML <img> element to define an image
    Use the HTML src attribute to define the URL of the image
    Use the HTML alt attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed
    Use the HTML width and height attributes to define the size of the image
    Use the CSS width and height properties to define the size of the image (alternatively)
    Use the CSS float property to let the image float
    Use the HTML <map> element to define an image-map
    Use the HTML <area> element to define the clickable areas in the image-map
    Use the HTML <img>'s element usemap attribute to point to an image-map
    Use the HTML <picture> element to show different images for different devices

    <img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" width="128" height="128">
    <img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;"> 
    second way (style) to set width and height is better as it prevents style sheets to change the width and
    height of image from external stylesheet.

    Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text:
    <p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;">
    The image will float to the right of the text.</p>

Image Maps:
    The <map> tag defines an image-map. An image-map is an image with clickable areas.
    
    <img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">
    <map name="workmap">
    <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
    <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="phone.htm">
    <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Coffee" href="coffee.htm">
    </map>

HTML <picture> Element :
    The <picture> element contains a number of <source> elements, each referring to different image sources. This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.
    <picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
    <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
    <img src="img_girl.jpg">
    </picture>

    Use the HTML <ol> element to define an ordered list
    Use the HTML type attribute to define the numbering type
    Use the HTML <li> element to define a list item
    Use the HTML <dl> element to define a description list
    Use the HTML <dt> element to define the description term
    Use the HTML <dd> element to describe the term in a description list
    Lists can be nested inside lists
    List items can contain other HTML elements
    Use the CSS property float:left or display:inline to display a list horizontally

HTML Iframes:
    An iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.
    <iframe src="URL"></iframe>

Iframe - Target for a Link
    The target attribute of the link must refer to the name attribute of the iframe:
    <iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" name="iframe_a"></iframe>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="iframe_a">W3Schools.com</a></p>

The HTML <noscript> Tag

What is Responsive Web Design?
    Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge,
    a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones):

Responsive Images:Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.
    <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">

Responsive Text Size:he text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width"    
    <h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1>

Media Queries:
    With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes.
/*==========================================================================================*/

The <form> Element:

    The HTML <form> element defines a form that is used to collect user input.
    Normally, the form data is sent to a web page on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

    The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.
    <form action="/action_page.php">

    The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when submitting the form data:
    <form action="/action_page.php" method="get"> 

    Each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.
    If the name attribute is omitted, the data of that input field will not be sent at all.

    accept-charset	    Specifies the charset used in the submitted form (default: the page charset).
    action	            Specifies an address (url) where to submit the form (default: the submitting page).
    autocomplete	    Specifies if the browser should autocomplete the form (default: on).
    enctype	            Specifies the encoding of the submitted data (default: is url-encoded).
    method	            Specifies the HTTP method used when submitting the form (default: GET).
    name	            Specifies a name used to identify the form (for DOM usage: document.forms.name).
    novalidate	        Specifies that the browser should not validate the form.
    target	            Specifies the target of the address in the action attribute (default: _self).
